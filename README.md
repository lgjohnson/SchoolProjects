# School Projects
Some projects/assignments from my MS Statistics program organized by class:

1. Computational Statistics
2. Biostatistics
3. [Time Series](https://github.com/lgjohnson/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Time%20Series)
4. [Spatial Statistics](https://github.com/lgjohnson/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Spatial%20Analysis)
5. Multivariate Statistics
6. [Categorical Data Analysis](https://github.com/lgjohnson/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Categorical%20Data%20Analysis)
7. [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/lgjohnson/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Bayesian%20Statistics)


All analyses were done in R and reported using Word, RMarkdown, or a Latex editor. Note that all of the R coding was done before I began to implement the tidyverse ecosystem in my work.

Also includes an SEM class and Psychometrics/IRT class that were taken outside of my program. Projects were written in properietary languages EQS and flexMIRT, respectively. I have only provided the final reports/presentations.

8. [Structural Equation Modeling](https://github.com/lgjohnson/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Structural%20Equation%20Modeling)
9. [Item Response Theory](https://github.com/lgjohnson/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Item%20Response%20Theory)
