# SchoolProjects
Some projects/assignments from my MS Statistics program organized by class:

1. Computational Statistics
2. Biostatistics
3. [Time Series](https://github.com/lgjohnson/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Time%20Series)
4. [Spatial Statistics](https://github.com/lgjohnson/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Spatial%20Analysis)
5. Multivariate Statistics
6. [Categorical Data Analysis](https://github.com/lgjohnson/SchoolProjects/tree/master/Categorical%20Data%20Analysis)
7. Bayesian Statistics


All analyses were done in R and reported using Word, RMarkdown, or a Latex editor. Note that all of the R coding was done before I began to implement the tidyverse ecosystem in my work.
